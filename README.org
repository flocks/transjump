* Transjump

Quickly jump to your favorite folders with transient.el

** Motivation

Packages such as projectile.el or even the built-in project.el offer a
good way to navigate through a lot of differents projects but I felt
it was a bit slow for the top 3/4 projects I'm constantly working
on. I'm constantly switching from one project to another and having to
type `C-x p p` then typing the first letter of the project name was
too much for me.

** Overview

With transjump, I define a list of favorite folders and attribute to each
folder a `key` and a `name`.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq transjump-folders
		'((:name  "frontend" :key  "f" :path  "~/path/to/front/project")
		  (:name  "backend" :key  "b" :path  "~/path/to/back/project")
		  (:name  "home" :key  "h" :path  "~")
		  (:name  "downloads" :key  "m" :path  "~/Downloads")
		  (:name  "music" :key  "m" :path  "~/Music")))
#+END_SRC

And transjump will generate a transient menu.

So I can jump the desired folder with a single keypress. 

Sometimes switching to the folder is not enough and you want to create
a dedicated tab for it. It's what's happening when you use an
universal prefix argument. If the tab already exists, it just switches
to it
